   * This file contains the code for the map tab of the display      *
   * screen of a photo manager application that presents users the   *
   * thumbnails of all the currently available pictures and allows   *
   * them to add new pictures using the camera. New pictures are     *
   * automatically tagged with the current GPS coordinates and may   *
   * optionally be tagged with audio.                                *

   * When a thumbnail is selected, it will be displayed in a new     *
   * screen. The user will be able to play back any associated audio *
   * and also display a map showing the GPS coordinates of where     *
   * that picture was taken. Thus, the second screen of the photo    *
   * manager application consists of two tabs: one for showing the   *
   * picture and the other for showing the GPS coordinates of where  *
   * that picture was taken.                                         *

   * This file contains the code for the map tab, which shows a map  *
   * of the vicinity of where the picture was taken with a pin on    *
   * the map to indicate the exact spot.                             *
   *                                                                 *
